try to create web pages accessing the functionalities.

<i>i can do it with Jquery as i have experience with it.</i>


created an API app that does GET,POST,PUT,DELETE.

by GET localhost:3000/ -get the list of items as JSON
by GET localhost:3000/1 - get the details of an item as JSON
<i>NOTE: any get aside from these two does nothing.</i>

by POST localhost:3000/ add an item to database by JSON
<i>NOTE: any post aside from this does nothing.</i>

by DELETE localhost:3000/1 deletes a specific item specified in the res.params.itemId
<i>NOTE: any delete aside from this one does nothing.</i>


by PUT localhost:3000/1 update a specific item specified in the res.params.itemId
<i>NOTE: any put aside from this one does nothing.</i>
